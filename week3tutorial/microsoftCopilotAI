Absolutely, Marko! Here's a refined and professional version of your original logic design documentation, broken into clear sections with improved clarity, grammar, and formatting:

---

## **Step 1: Understand and Define the Problem (Analysis)**

The goal is to design and simulate a **combinational logic circuit** for a seat belt sensor system. The system monitors:

- **Seat occupancy sensors** (driver and passenger)
- **Seat belt sensors** (driver and passenger)
- **Ignition status**
- **Alarm output**

The alarm should activate **only when the ignition is ON** and **an occupied front seat has an unfastened seatbelt**. The system assumes:

- It functions perfectly (no faults or malfunctions).
- The driver is always present (a passenger without a driver is not considered valid).
- The alarm is unnecessary if seats are unoccupied.

## **Step 2: Organise and Describe the Data**

| **Symbol** | **Meaning**                          | **Type** | **Active Logic**         |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| `DRIV`     | Driver is in the seat                | Input    | HIGH (1 = present)       |
| `PASS`     | Passenger is in the seat             | Input    | HIGH (1 = present)       |
| `IGN`      | Ignition switch is ON                | Input    | HIGH (1 = ON)            |
| `BELTD`    | Driver's seatbelt is unfastened      | Input    | LOW (0 = unfastened)     |
| `BELTP`    | Passenger's seatbelt is unfastened   | Input    | LOW (0 = unfastened)     |
| `ALARM`    | Alarm signal                         | Output   | LOW (0 = alarm sounds)   |

---

## **Step 3: Plan the Solution (Design the Algorithm)**

The logic follows these steps:

1. **Check ignition status**:
   - If `IGN = 1` (car is running), proceed.

2. **Driver seat check**:
   - If `DRIV = 1` and `BELTD = 0`, activate alarm (`ALARM = 0`).

3. **Passenger seat check**:
   - If `PASS = 1` and `BELTP = 0`, activate alarm (`ALARM = 0`).

4. **Alarm OFF condition**:
   - If all occupied seats have fastened seatbelts (`BELTD = 1` and/or `BELTP = 1`), and ignition is ON, then `ALARM = 1`.

---

## **Logic Summary**

The alarm activates (`ALARM = 0`) when:

- `IGN = 1` **AND**
  - (`DRIV = 1` **AND** `BELTD = 0`) **OR**
  - (`PASS = 1` **AND** `BELTP = 0`)

Otherwise, the alarm remains OFF (`ALARM = 1`).

---

## **Truth Table Overview**

With 5 inputs, the truth table will have \(2^5 = 32\) rows. Each row represents a unique combination of:

- `IGN`, `DRIV`, `BELTD`, `PASS`, `BELTP`

And the corresponding output `ALARM`.

Would you like me to generate the full truth table for you as well? Or perhaps a diagram of the logic circuit?
